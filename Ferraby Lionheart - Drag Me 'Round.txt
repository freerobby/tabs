Verse:
(G intro)
                C      Em
Well if this is counterfeit
     (Em)      C    C/B   Dsus2
It's good, you must ad----mit
          G           C               Dsus2        Em
Cause you sway when I sing and you're sad when I'm mean
      G          D           G
And I never want to get over it

Chorus:
C          G
You drag me 'round
B7               C
Kick me when I'm down
Am                              Dsus2
How did you become the cause of me?
C              G    
I try to leave town
        B7            C
but you pin me to the ground
G             D             G
By and by I'm asking you to stay
